      <h2> <strong>Description:</strong></h2>
      <p>My partner and I used a pre-exisitng scartch game whose level design and sprites were modified according to personal preference. New levels added included differing ball sprites and timing as well as most notable a progressive difficulty system based on random basket movement. I was responsible for creating the score system as well as difficulty system for which I used a number operation which resulted in seemingly random results which was combined with sharply increased frequency of changing values as the levels went on. I also alternated with documentation duty. We faced many obstacles starting with figuring out the seemingly simple but new scratch ennvironment as well as assigning new sprites and a score system that didn't source the right values. Furhtermore, due to the limtited possible oeprations provided in Scratch, I had to use trial and error in order to come up with the number operation that would form the difficulty system.</p>

      <h2> <strong>Description:</strong></h2>
      <p>My partner and I decided to play to our strenghts by letting myself focus on the strategy creation while he focused on the documentation and we both came together to translate our work to code. We at first had to figure out how the simulator worked and the various unspoken rules that came with it and then try and use the pre-existing strategies as inspiration for our own. This project had more thinking and testing attached than most other projects as a successful strategy wasn't exactly an intuitive one.</p>
